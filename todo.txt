THEN WE DO THE WRITING
  Do some unexplainable anomalous shit, make it somewhat clear to the player how it works, but don't be explicit
  Things you should be comfortable with, but exists outside the perceivable spectrum
    ie. The Colour Out of Space, the breathing in Beck + Call by July Talk, some other sounds
      Maybe the character describes some sound. "Can you hear that?" but the player can't. Until later, it starts to creep in.
      plays at odd times. Ideally plays even outside of the app. Plays more often the more time spent in the app.
    For the presentation, can I say that we didn't get sound in the game yet (but be lying?)
      Blood capsules in my ear? mouth? nose?
    Really really low vocals that people might not hear. Maybe can try to test for volume increases and if so really jam it up on 'em?
    Maybe could do some sort of cool unexplained visuals for the demo also?
    Flashing 'subliminal' messages? Maybe the faces on the poker faces flash something sinister?
    If you leave the app or go to a menu, when you return the poker face is closer (sometimes)
    Pretend closing the app?
    Pretend notifications?

Things to revisit later
  Wheel speed balanced well?
  Combo visuals
