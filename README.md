Slotterhouse is a Narrative Horror Slot Machine RPG Experience, developed for the third Cubic game jam (Oct 18).

It was built in 30ish nights and weekends, leaning on Phaser CE and Twine.

It features over 40 player skills, over 15 enemy skills, an innovative slot machine combat mechanic and upgrade system, and a narrative that is only very partially written.

Development is probably dead at this point, as I wasn't able to get the mechanic to be terribly fun during testing. But it was a prototype, and that is the purpose of a prototype. Still got a lot done and I feel like I explored the original idea I had enough to call this a success regardless.
